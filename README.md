# CS 430 Project 5 Image viewer 

In this project we will create an image viewer. Our image viewer should be able to load PPM images in P3 or P6 format and display the image in a window. We should also have mouse and/or keyboard controls to perform all the affine transformations on the image:
• Translate (pan)• Rotate • Scale • Shear
